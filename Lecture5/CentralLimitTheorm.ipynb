    "Laplace published generalization of the CLT in 1776, 1785 and 1820. A rigorous proof, close to the modern form, was published by Chebyshev in 1887. Feller and Lévy worked on genralizations and some special cases into the mid 1930s. Any theorm that would attract the attention of so many methameticians over so long a period of time must be important!"
